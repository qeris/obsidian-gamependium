**Kakariko Village** (pronounced /[ˌkɑː.kəˈriː.koʊ](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda_Wiki:Pronunciation_Guide "Zelda Wiki:Pronunciation Guide")/, _KAH-kə-REE-koh_),[[1]](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Kakariko_Village?so=search#cite_note-King_Rhoam-1) also known as **Kakariko Town**,[[2]](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Kakariko_Village?so=search#cite_note-2) is a recurring location in [_The Legend of Zelda_ series](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(Series) "The Legend of Zelda (Series)") Its geographical and historical situation seems to change in each game. It may have been inspired by various towns in _[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link")_ and, in turn, may have served as the inspiration for such future towns in the series – [Mabe Village](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Mabe_Village#Link's_Awakening "Mabe Village"), [Clock Town](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Clock_Town#Majora's_Mask "Clock Town"), [Lynna City](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Lynna_City#Oracle_of_Ages "Lynna City"), [Horon Village](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Horon_Village#Oracle_of_Seasons "Horon Village"), [Windfall Island](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Windfall_Island#The_Wind_Waker "Windfall Island"), [Hyrule Town](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hyrule_Town#The_Minish_Cap "Hyrule Town"), and various minor villages.

## Features and Overview
In _[Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild")_, Kakariko Village is a settlement in the [West Necluda](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/West_Necluda "West Necluda") region of Hyrule, north of the [Dueling Peaks](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Peaks "Dueling Peaks"). One hundred years ago, during the Great Calamity, it avoided damage from the Guardian's assault.[[30]](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Kakariko_Village#cite_note-30) It contains several houses, gardens, and a selection of stores, including [High Spirits Produce](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/High_Spirits_Produce "High Spirits Produce"), a general store where travelers can purchase locally grown food and supplies; [Shuteye Inn](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Shuteye_Inn "Shuteye Inn"), which allows travelers to rest and regenerate [Hearts](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Heart "Heart"); [The Curious Quiver](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Curious_Quiver "The Curious Quiver"), a store that specializes in [Arrows](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Arrow "Arrow"); and [Enchanted](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Enchanted "Enchanted"), a boutique that sells [Armor](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Armor "Armor"). There are also hidden items in Kakariko village, such as a [Eightfold blade](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eightfold_Blade "Eightfold Blade") on top of a pillar of Grass and dirt behind another pillar and Impa's building.

Link is told to go to Kakariko Village after completing the four [Ancient Shrines](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Shrine "Ancient Shrine") located on the [Great Plateau](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Plateau "Great Plateau"), when the [Old Man](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Man "Old Man") reveals himself to be the former King of Hyrule and informs Link of the events that transpired 100 years ago. After his explanation, [King Rhoam](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/King_Rhoam "King Rhoam") suggests that Link travel east to Kakariko Village where he can find the Village elder, [Impa](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Impa "Impa"). Upon his arrival, several people recognise him for who he is due to the Sheikah Slate, those being Nanna, who used to work with ancient technology, her granddaughter Lasli, and Impa's bodyguards [Cado](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Cado "Cado") and [Dorian](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Dorian "Dorian"). The farmer [Steen](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Steen "Steen") comments on how Link looks like the Hylian [Champion](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Champion "Champion") from a century prior, but dismisses his claims of being that hero as Link is missing the [Master Sword](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Sword "Master Sword"). Link is introduced to Impa's granddaughter, [Paya](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Paya "Paya"), who after noticing the [Sheikah Slate](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Sheikah_Slate "Sheikah Slate") dangling from his hip, affirms that Link is indeed the hero her grandmother told her about and urges him to meet with her quickly. Impa notices that Link has lost his [Memory](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Memory "Memory") upon their reunion and recounts to him the history of the [Divine Beasts](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Beast "Divine Beast"), urging him to free them from Ganon's evil influence. Additionally, she also tells Link that the director of the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab, [Purah](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Purah "Purah"), might be able to unlock the full potential of his Sheikah Slate if he speaks with her. If Link has reclaimed at least one of his lost Memories, Impa will also gift him his old [Champion's Tunic](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Champion%27s_Tunic "Champion's Tunic").

Kakariko Village features a [Fairy Fountain](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Fairy_Fountain "Fairy Fountain") in a forested plateau overlooking the Village. Link is directed to the Fountain by [Pikango](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Pikango "Pikango") through the [Main Quest](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Quest "Main Quest") "[Find the Fairy Fountain](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Find_the_Fairy_Fountain "Find the Fairy Fountain")". After giving the weakened [Great Fairy](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Fairy "Great Fairy") [Cotera](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Cotera "Cotera") her requested sum of [Rupees](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Rupee "Rupee"), she will henceforth offer to upgrade Link's Armor in exchange for [Materials](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Material "Material") in gratitude. An Ancient Shrine is also located near the Fountain, the [Lakna Rokee Shrine](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Lakna_Rokee_Shrine "Lakna Rokee Shrine"), though it is initially buried. Later on in the game, an ancient Sheikah heirloom found within Impa's house is stolen, greatly distressing both Impa and Paya. They suspect that someone must have infiltrated their home during the night, and ask Link to investigate the situation, beginning the [Shrine Quest](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine_Quest "Shrine Quest") "[The Stolen Heirloom](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Stolen_Heirloom "The Stolen Heirloom")" It is later revealed that [Dorian](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Dorian "Dorian"), one of Impa's gatekeepers, was once a member of the [Yiga Clan](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Yiga_Clan "Yiga Clan"), and that he tipped off a [Yiga Blademaster](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Yiga_Blademaster "Yiga Blademaster") about the ancient heirloom in order to preserve Impa's and Paya's lives. Once recovered, the heirloom is used to reveal the Lakna Rokee Shrine.

Stylistically, Kakariko Village is dramatically different from its previous incarnations in the series. In previous installments, as a [Hylian](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hylian "Hylian") settlement, the village adopted traditional [medieval architecture](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Medieval_elements_in_The_Legend_of_Zelda_Universe#Buildings "Medieval elements in The Legend of Zelda Universe"). In _Breath of the Wild_, Kakariko Village is a [Sheikah](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Sheikah#Breath_of_the_Wild "Sheikah") settlement, having an aesthetic reminiscent of several historic periods of Japan, such as the [Asuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_period "wikipedia:Asuka period") and [Jōmon periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon_period "wikipedia:Jōmon period"). Kakariko is very important to the clan as 20 of the 21 Sheikah NPCs have lived there at some point. All the Researchers were originally accommodated there at some point before moving to the Tech Labs, as was [Pikango](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Pikango "Pikango") until he decided to travel the world in search of scenic landscapes[[_citation needed_](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Citing_Sources "Help:Citing Sources")]. The only one who hasn't was [Granté](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Grant%C3%A9 "Granté"), but that is because he was born and raised in the [Akkala Ancient Tech Lab](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Akkala_Ancient_Tech_Lab "Akkala Ancient Tech Lab") before settling in [Tarrey Town](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Tarrey_Town "Tarrey Town").
