## Features and Overview
Eldin Canyon is a vast area within [Eldin](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eldin_(Region) "Eldin (Region)"), comprising of almost the entirety of the Region. The Canyon primarily covers southern and central Eldin, and stretches to the far northeast along the ends of [Hyrule](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hyrule "Hyrule"). The southern portion of the Canyon is a valley with rolling foothills that borders along [Great Hyrule Forest](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Hyrule_Forest "Great Hyrule Forest"), [Hyrule Field](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hyrule_Field "Hyrule Field"), and northern [Lanayru](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Lanayru_(Region) "Lanayru (Region)"). A road paves through this section before forking between Eldin proper and Lanayru. This winding road then leads to the [Foothill Stable](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Foothill_Stable "Foothill Stable") before continuing into central Eldin. The valley is initially even and partially wooded, especially toward the west, however, further north it increasingly turns more rugged and mountainous closer to central Eldin.

The central portion of Eldin Canyon has harder terrain with steep cliffs and deep gorges. Further to the north and closer to [Death Mountain](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Mountain "Death Mountain"), the landscape turns more perilous due to the area's high volcanic activity. Eruptions caused by Death Mountain have formed multiple bodies and rivers of lava around the area, as such as [Darunia Lake](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Darunia_Lake "Darunia Lake") and the moat that surrounds Death Mountain. Due to the intense climate, the [Temperature](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") grows exceedingly hot here, and puts Link in danger of catching fire along with any wooden Gear that is equipped. The high Temperature can be remedied either by consuming [Food](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Food#Breath_of_the_Wild "Food") or an [Elixir](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Food "Food") that grants fire resistance, or by wearing any one of the [Flamebreaker Set](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Flamebreaker_Set "Flamebreaker Set"). The road that paves through central Eldin Canyon eventually leads to [Goron City](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Goron_City "Goron City"), the home of the [Gorons](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Goron "Goron"), before continuing to the [Abandoned North Mine](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_North_Mine "Abandoned North Mine") and finally Death Mountain.

The northernmost portion gives way to a mountainous, barren wasteland that has little to no substance. This area borders along the very edge of Hyrule as a steep, bottomless cliff known as [Eldin's Flank](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eldin%27s_Flank "Eldin's Flank"). Eldin Canyon shares much of this landscape with the [Eldin Mountains](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eldin_Mountains "Eldin Mountains") to the west.

Throughout Eldin Canyon, a number of bodies of water close to Death Mountain are [Hot Springs](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Spring "Hot Spring"), and will gradually recover Link's health as he stands or swims in them.

The Mine is home to several Cannons belonging to Bludo, which when used in conjunction with the [Remote Bomb](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Remote_Bomb "Remote Bomb") [Rune](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Rune "Rune"), can be used to fire cannonballs. [Fire-Breath Lizalfos](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Fire-Breath_Lizalfos "Fire-Breath Lizalfos") have built a number of outposts around the area.

A woman named [Gaile](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Gaile "Gaile") notably sells [Fireproof Elixirs](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Fireproof_Elixir "Fireproof Elixir") at the Stable, invaluable for travelers aiming to trek into the Region's hotter climate.

Finding the Tunnel is integral to the [Shrine Quest](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine_Quest "Shrine Quest") "[A Brother's Roast](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/A_Brother%27s_Roast "A Brother's Roast")".
