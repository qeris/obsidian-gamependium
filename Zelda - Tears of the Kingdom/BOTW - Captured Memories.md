## [[Sacred Ground Ruins]]
![[Pasted image 20230204181330.png]]
The first memory in your album is easy to reach, but beware of the Guardians patrolling the area.

![[Pasted image 20230204181718.png]]
The location is directly to the south of Hyrule Castle.
 
![[Pasted image 20230204181838.png]]
Zooming in on the map will reveal a little puddle of water labeled Sacred Ground Ruins.

![[Pasted image 20230204181940.png]]
Take out the Guardians or sneak to the centre to see a glowing light. Step into it and hit recall to watch a cutscene, then consider hotfooting it out of there.

## [[Lake Kolomo]]
![[Pasted image 20230204182148.png]]
This memory looks deceptive close to the Dueling Peaks, but is quite far out to the west.Â 

![[Pasted image 20230204182221.png]]
Head south of Central Tower until you reach a lake.

![[Pasted image 20230204182242.png]]
There's a road that leads directly to the lake. Follow it and veer off to the left when it ends.

![[Pasted image 20230204182258.png]]
You'll spot the area from the photo here, along with the memory to the right of it.

## [[Ancient Columns]]
![[Pasted image 20230204182425.png]]
The next memory is in Hebra.

![[Pasted image 20230204182440.png]]
Head south from Tabantha Tower and follow the road to Tena Ko'sah Shrine.

![[Pasted image 20230204182455.png]]
The Ancient Columns surround the shrine.

![[Pasted image 20230204182506.png]]
The memory is on the path leading up to its entrance.

## [[Kara Kara Bazaar]]
![[Pasted image 20230204183035.png]]
The bazaar is in the south west part of the map, in Gerudo.

![[Pasted image 20230204183048.png]]
Being in Gerudo, you'll need Chilly food or potions to cool you down, or the Gerudo armour set.

![[Pasted image 20230204183102.png]]
Follow the road south west from Gerudo Canyon Stable. If you have a lot of healing items, you can essentially brute force your way there by topping up your HP gauge when it gets too low from heat damage.

![[Pasted image 20230204183147.png]]
You might arrive nude and dehydrated, but as soon as you recall the memory, you can fast travel out of there.

## [[Eldin Canyon]]
![[Pasted image 20230205103936.png]]
Depending on you how plot your route here, you'll either need Flamebreaker armour to avoid bursting into flame, or a lot of stamina replenishing items for the climb up.

![[Pasted image 20230205103951.png]]
Eldin Canyon is on the upper right of the map, to the south west of Death Mountain.

![[Pasted image 20230205104007.png]]
The mountain we're after is directly to the west of Goronbi Lake.

![[Pasted image 20230205104038.png]]
More specifically, it has a Korok stone circle on top.
